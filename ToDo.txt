-Put tasks that have a due date closer to the current date higher on the list (closed for now, too much effort for something insignificant)
-Make option to set 1, 2, or no reminders for due dates. (low priority)
-Option to edit due dates and names for assignments even after they are submitted and on the list.
  -Upon right clicking an assignment and clicking the "edit" option, that assignment is removed from the list,
 but its details are auto filled into the respective link, date, and name fields. User can then resubmit based of this
 assignment for effectively "modifying" the assignment.
